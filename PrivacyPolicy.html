<p><p align="center"> <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
<p><p>Picked.email strive to provide personal classifications to your emails to help reduce your time spent on managing emails. Picked.email takes your privacy seriously. Please read our privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") carefully to learn more about our service. You are required to agree to the Privacy Policy before start using/testing our product. By agreeing to the policy, you acknowledge that you will comply to all terms listed in Privacy Policy (as well as App Store End User License Agreement) and fully understand the risk involved.
<p><p><strong>Introduction</strong>
<p><p>This Privacy Policy describes what information we collect when you use our mobile app product ("PickedMail”) and how we use this information. This policy serves as an addition to the App Store End User License Agreement. The information PickedMail gathers is used solely for purposes of providing better service to you. If the content of our service changes, we would update our Privacy Policy. We do not loan, rent or sell information to others, other than as stated herein. We are committed to protect your privacy. We collect two types of information through the PickedMail app: General Statistical Information and Personal Information.
<p><p><strong>General Statistical Information</strong>
<p><p>When you use the PickedMail app we gather statistics and analytics on your usage of the app through Crashlytics. We may collect information about your mobile device and internet connection, including the application-specific device identifier, IP address, operating system, browser type, mobile network information, location, installed email etc. This information is collectively referred to as "General Statistical Information". This data helps us to determine how different parts of the PickedMail app are used. This information is used by us to provide you with the best user experience possible.
<p><p><strong>Personal Information</strong>
<p><p>In addition to General Statistical Information, we also collect personally information. Information that can reasonably be used to identify you and your personal traits is referred to as "Personal Information". The first email address you add to Picked.email is used as your username. We might use that email address to reach out to you periodically with information about features, updates, announcements or to request your feedback. After a user register and grant permission, Picked.email server may download and store the full content of user's emails. Only plain text information and HTML text (excluding attachments) will be processed by the Picked.email server, in order to provide email service that refers to your personal need. The email information stored on the server will be unanonymous in order to provide personal classification to your email. However, the information will not be directly accessed without your approval.
<p><p><strong>Data Security</strong>
<p><p>Accounts are added to Picked.email through OAuth where possible. OAuth is an industry standard for authorizing secure delegated access to external apps and service providers. When connecting Trove via OAuth, we never receive or store your password and you can revoke our access at anytime.
<p><p>We use Vultr’s cloud infrastructure to store your data. Apart from the Vultr' security policies, we take a number of measures to ensure that your data is never read by anyone else. We ensure that all data transmissions are secured using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. The safety and security of your information also depends on you. You should not share your email user name and password with anyone. If you find out that anyone has improperly obtained your login credentials and accesses your email account through PickedMail, you should immediately contact the administrator. We are not responsible for such unauthorized access.
<p><p><strong>Use of Personal Information</strong>
<p><p>Picked.email does not rent, sell, or share personally identifiable information about you with non-affiliated third parties, except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We believe it is necessary to share personally identifiable information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Picked.email’s terms of use, this privacy policy, or as otherwise required by law. We believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of our company, our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
<p><p>We transfer your information in the event a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding and you agree to and do hereby consent to our assignment or transfer of rights to your Personal Information.
<p><p><strong>Confidentiality and Security</strong>
<p><p>We limit access to Personal Information about you to employees, contractors and service providers who we believe reasonably need have access to that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
<p><p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong>
<p><p>If Picked.email were to post any changes to the Privacy Policy, we would notify you by email and update this page as soon as possible. Your continued use of the Picked.email service after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the Privacy Policy updates.
<p><p><strong>Questions and Suggestions</strong>
<p><p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us by emailing kedan@thywis.com.
